# /data is a type of hybrid between /var, /home, and /opt. It stores temporary
# and/or permanent items or anything else that pertains to your Spoke's needs.

# A database for example could keep it's files in here in it's own directory, or,
# if your process is for analyzing a data set, an Axle container would persist
# it, but it will become accessible in this folder.
