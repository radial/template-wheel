/data is a type of hybrid between /var, /home, and /opt. It stores temporary
and/or permanent items or anything else that pertains to your Spoke's needs.

Source code could potentially be stored in here as well, but make sure you know
how you'd like to use that data. Does one temporary Spoke container manage the
downloading/configuring/compiling of the source code into a binary that a
another Spoke container finally runs? This situation would warrant the use of a
/data/src folder. If you have very slow release cycles in your source, you
might be better off keeping your Hub container small and just doing all that
work in the main application's Spoke container.
