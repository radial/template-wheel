# This folder is not added by the 'radial/hub-base' image by default and shouldn't
# even exist in your typical Wheel repository. It is
# created dynamically by either your 'logs' axle container (which makes it's way
# into this hub via `--volumes-from logs` or is created fresh by the
# 'radial/hub-base' and exposed via `VOLUME` there. The folder is only included
# here for completeness and to house this message.
