The point of Axle containers is to persist data and bind-mounts to the host.
This means that Dockerfiles are useless for perscripting their creation.
Perhaps we use bash scripts? YAML files? Chances are, the required axle
containers will need to be tested if already existing (ie. logs). and we don't
want to recreate it if it is.
