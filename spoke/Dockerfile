# Spoke Dockerfile for {{template}}
#
# This is an example Spoke container Dockerfile. If your desired application is
# a standard package provided by the radial/distro operating system (Ubuntu
# Trusty), then this trully is all you would need; just install the package. All
# application configuration as well as your application's .ini file is
# added/cloned/managed by the Hub container.

# GH_USER needs to be specified if you have a Github account and want your
# public keys automatically imported into your container for easy SSH support.
# This is 'secure' in that use of public keys are always secure, but it is not
# the wisest strategy to use the same key-pair for multiple venues (server
# cluster, public website, etc.). More robust key management is a feature for a
# future date. For now, this suffices for protypting and development on small
# clusters. This can be specified here with the ENV instruction, or via
# commandline at runtime.

# A mandatory item is the declaration of the SPOKE_NAME variable. Because the
# /config/supervisor/conf.d directory is shared by all spokes, individual
# programs are specifically set to not autostart. As a result, setting this
# variable will be a unique identifier used by Supervisor to start this Spokes
# program and not any of the others.

# Notice that there is no CMD or ENTRYPOINT. This is because a default
# ENTRYPOINT is already declared in the 'radial/spoke-base' image. It does many
# things that make this container work predictably, so take care when replacing
# it in this Spoke Dockerfile.
